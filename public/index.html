                <p>
                  The best Neapolitan pizza should have a big, beautiful crust
                  that's slightly crispy and is covered with little dark spots
                  caused by the sizzling heat. The centre of the pizza should be
                  thin and mostly soft and have just a few delicious toppings
                  combined with a gentle touch of smoke from the wood-fired
                  oven.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using your fingertips, press the dough gently from the center
                  outward, working in a circular motion while avoiding the edges
                  to preserve the airy crust. Rotate the dough as you press,
                  allowing it to stretch naturally. Let gravity assist in the
                  process by lifting the dough and letting it stretch evenly.
                  Handle the dough with minimal pressure to maintain the
                  delicate network of bubbles that will create the perfect light
                  and airy texture when baked. This careful method ensures that
                  the final crust will have the signature puff and slight
                  charring that defines an authentic Neapolitan pizza.

                <p>
                  When Italians started immigrating to America, they took their
                  beloved pizza with them to the USA. Most Italians started
                  making pizza in coal or gas ovens that weren't as hot as the
                  wood-fired ovens in Italy. This meant that the pizza needed
                  more time to bake and that the recipe had to be adjusted to
                  the longer baking time. This is how the New York pizza was
                  born.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When stretching out a New York pizza you will leave it
                  slightly thicker than a Neapolitan or a Roman pizza.
                </p>
                <p>It takes between 8 and 15 minutes to bake.</p>
                <p>
                  A Neapolitan pizza would dry out during this period. The New
                  Yorker doesn't because of its key ingredients: oil &amp;
                  sugar. The oil protects the dough from drying out and the
                  sugar helps the crust to brown more evenly, giving it more
                  flavour.

                </p>
                <p>
                  The Sicilian pizza is a very versatile pizza that goes by lots
                  of different names, depending on the region, city, or country
                  where it's made. Though the name and the toppings may vary a
                  lot, the basics stay the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These pizzas have a thicker, softer, and more bread-like
                  texture than the Neapolitan, Roman or New York pizza. They're
                  baked in a pan or baking tray that's coated heavily with olive
                  oil. As the oil heats up in the oven, it will fry the base of
                  the pizza, making it super crispy and delicious.

            <p>
              When making pizza, you'll first need to make the dough balls
              before they can be turned into those delicious wood-fired pieces
              of heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sizing of dough balls for Neapolitan and American pizza is
              pretty similar. Pizzas come in small, medium and large sizes. The
              calculator is set for medium pizzas. If you're planning to make
              your pizzas a different size, you can change this setting.
            </p>
            <p>
              The figure below shows the right dough ball weight for the
              different pizza sizes. As you can see, the calculator adds a bit
              of weight for the American pizza, because the American pizza is
              supposed to be a bit thicker than the Neapolitan.

            <p>
              The sizing of this pizza is a bit different, since this pizza
              isn't baked on the stone in your oven, but in a baking tray/pan
              that goes into your oven. Seeing as everyone has different baking
              trays, you can't just talk about small or medium pizzas.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a 25x20cm / 10×8-inch baking tray, you'll need to make 650
              grams of dough. If your baking tray is bigger or smaller, you'll
              have to play around with the weight until you find the perfect
              recipe for your baking pan.

                <p>
                  You produce flour by grinding grain, primarily wheat. There
                  are two types of grain: a hard and a soft type. Hard grain is
                  ground into a yellow flour, which is best for making pasta,
                  and soft grain is ground into a white flour, which is great
                  for bread and pizza. For the best possible pizza dough, you
                  need a very fine white flour that can only be obtained after a
                  long and slow process of grinding and sifting the wheat. The
                  finest flour you can buy is known as tipo 00.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Due to its fineness, tipo 00 flour can absorb very large
                  amounts of water, ranging from 50% all the way up to 100%.
                  This allows your pizza to stay nice and crispy, without drying
                  out in the oven.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you can't find tipo 00 flour, you can use regular bread
                  flour. You should never use all-purpose or cake flour. If you
                  use bread flour, which hasn't been sieved as finely as tipo
                  00, you won't be able to use as much water. It's still
                  possible to make pretty good pizzas with normal bread flour,
                  but I'd recommend only using between 50% and 60% water to
                  prevent the dough from getting soupy.

                <h3 id="yeast-info">Yeast</h3>
                <p>
                  Yeast is a single-celled organism that is invisible to the
                  naked eye.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This organism feeds on the sugars and starch in your dough and
                  releases gases that create little air pockets in the dough,
                  which will make it rise and give it great flavour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Why is there so little yeast in pizza dough?
                </p>
                <p>
                  That's because pizza dough is supposed to have a long, 8-hour
                  rise. When you're giving your dough this much time to rise,
                  even a little bit of yeast will do the trick. You could speed
                  up the process by adding more yeast, but I wouldn't recommend
                  that! A slow rise will enhance the dough's flavour, while also
                  making it more nutritional!
                </p>
                <p>
                  What if I use dry yeast instead of fresh yeast?
                </p>
                <p>
                  No problem. You can also use dry yeast. Just make sure to use
                  half as much as the amount of fresh yeast recommended by the
                  calculator. That's because dry yeast is concentrated, so dry
                  yeast is much more potent than the same amount of fresh yeast.

                <h3 id="water-info">Water</h3>
                <p>
                  The pizza dough calculator assumes that you're using "tipo 00"
                  flour. If this is the case, you won't need to make any changes
                  to the water percentage indicated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In case you're using regular bread flour, it would be wise to
                  set the parameter between 50% and 55%, since regular bread
                  flour can't absorb large quantities of water. If you don't use
                  less water with bread flour, your dough will get wet and
                  soupy.
                </p>

              <div class="col col-md-6 p-4">
                <h3 id="salt-info">Salt</h3>
                <p>
                  Salt mainly adds flavour to your dough, but it also protects
                  the dough against the effects of harmful bacteria and
                  strengthens the gluten structure within the dough.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the baking process, salt will give the crust a nice
                  brown colour.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I would recommend using sea salt or kosher salt instead of
                  table salt. Table salt is highly processed and only contains a
                  fraction of the beneficial minerals that sea and kosher salt
                  have.

              <li>
                <p>
                  First, take 2 bowls and add the amount of flour specified by
                  the calculator to one of them.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Fill the second bowl with the amount of water the calculator
                  tells you to use. Make sure that the water is cold
                  enough(anywhere between 12°C and 19°C will do).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Add your salt (preferably kosher salt or sea salt), stir it
                  into the water until it's completely dissolved.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Now it's time to dissolve the yeast in the water, but there's one
              big problem: Yeast doesn't like salty water, as the salt will
              damage the yeast. Which means your dough won't rise the way it's
              supposed to.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  So, you take some of the flour from bowl number one (about
                  10%) and mix it into your salty water. You don't have to be
                  super accurate, but it is a very important step because the
                  flour will protect the yeast against the salt, allowing it to
                  do its job properly.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Ok. When you've stirred the salt and 10% of the flour into
                  your water, you can add your fresh yeast. If you don't have
                  fresh yeast, you can use dry yeast, but make sure to use half
                  of the amount recommended by the calculator. (yes, it's a tiny
                  amount, but trust me, it works!) When the yeast is stirred
                  into the salty, flowery water you can add the rest of the
                  flour to it.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Now all the ingredients are in the bowl, you can loosely mix
                  them with a spoon or with your fingertips.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  When everything is mixed together, you can start kneading the
                  dough until it has an even, soft and elastic consistency. This
                  usually takes about 8 to 20 minutes of kneading.
                </p>

                  This will take less time than the next-level option, but it
                  will also give you a bit less complex flavour.

                      covered with cling film or a damp towel. Or even better,

                      take it out of the fridge, you place it on a lightly
                      flowered tabletop so you can portion the dough into balls
                      (Check the calculator to find out how large you should
                      make your balls of dough).

                    <p>
                      The last step is very important, the dough has to be at
                      room temperature before shaping it into pizzas so make
                      sure to wait for 2 to 4 hours.

            What's the difference between rising and proofing?
          </h4>

          <p>
            Hold up. Wait a minute… What has just happened? What is
            proofing/fermenting and why does this make next-level pizzas?
          </p>
          <p>
            After you first mixed the ingredients, you set 2 processes in
            motion.
          </p>
          <p>
            – In the first, the dough will start to rise because the yeast feeds
            on the sugars in the dough and produces gases that cause the dough
            to increase in size.
          </p>
          <p>
            – The other process is called proofing or fermenting. In this
            process, bacteria break down starches into simpler sugars.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two processes start at the same time, but proofing takes a lot
            longer because the bacteria have to break down all the starches to
            make an airy dough that's easy to digest. That's why real good dough
            needs at least 8 hours of rising and preferably even more time to
            proof.
          </p>
          <p>
            Proofing your dough for a long time leads to a tastier, more complex
            flavour, more beautiful charring and a pizza that's easier to
            digest. But you must stop the rising process by putting the dough in
            your fridge while the proofing process continues.
