## Styles

Flour, water, salt yeast and a blazing hot wood-fired oven. That's how the very first pizzas were made, and it's how they're still doing it today in Naples.

## Neapolitan pizza

The best Neapolitan pizza should have a big, beautiful crust that's slightly crispy and is covered with little dark spots caused by the sizzling heat. The centre of the pizza should be thin and mostly soft and have just a few delicious toppings combined with a gentle touch of smoke from the wood-fired oven.

### Ingredients ratio

- Tipo 00 or bread flour: 100%
- Salt: 3%
- Yeast: 0.2 %
- Water: 55% ‚Äì 75%

#### Instructions

Proofing at room temperature (min 6 ‚Äì max 24 hours) or cold fermenting (min 8 ‚Äì max 72 hours)  
Oven temperature: 400 ‚Äì 550¬∞C / 750 ‚Äì 1020‚Ñâ.  
Baking time: 1 ‚Äì 4 mins.

## New York pizza (American)

When Italians started immigrating to America, they took their beloved pizza with them to the USA. Most Italians started making pizza in coal or gas ovens that weren't as hot as the wood-fired ovens in Italy. This meant that the pizza needed more time to bake and that the recipe had to be adjusted to the longer baking time. This is how the New York pizza was born.

When stretching out a New York pizza you will leave it slightly thicker than a Neapolitan or a Roman pizza.

It takes between 8 and 15 minutes to bake.

A Neapolitan pizza would dry out during this period. The New Yorker doesn't because of its key ingredients: oil & sugar. The oil protects the dough from drying out and the sugar helps the crust to brown more evenly, giving it more flavour.

### Ingredients ratio

- Tipo 00 or bread flour: 100%
- Sugar: 2%
- Salt: 2%
- Fresh yeast: 0.4%
- Olive oil: 2.5%
- Water: 55% ‚Äì 65%

#### Instructions

Proofing at room temperature (min 6 ‚Äì max 24 hours) or cold fermenting (min 8 ‚Äì max 72 hours)  
Oven temperature: 200 ‚Äì 300¬∞C / 400 ‚Äì 580‚Ñâ.  
Baking time: 8 ‚Äì 15 min s.

## Sicilian pizza

_also known as sfincione , focaccia, thick-crust, deep-dish or pan pizza_

The Sicilian pizza is a very versatile pizza that goes by lots of different names, depending on the region, city, or country where it's made. Though the name and the toppings may vary a lot, the basics stay the same.

These pizzas have a thicker, softer, and more bread-like texture than the Neapolitan, Roman or New York pizza. They're baked in a pan or baking tray that's coated heavily with olive oil. As the oil heats up in the oven, it will fry the base of the pizza, making it super crispy and delicious.

### Ingredients ratio

- Tipo 00 or bread flour: 100%
- Salt: 2%
- Yeast: 1.5 %
- Olive oil: 1.5%
- Water: 55% ‚Äì 85%

#### Instructions

Proofing at room temperature (min 6 ‚Äì max 24 hours) or cold fermenting (min 8 ‚Äì max 72 hours)  
Oven temperature: 250 ‚Äì 280¬∞C /480 ‚Äì 540 ‚Ñâ.  
Baking time: 15 ‚Äì 20 mins.

## Size

### Neapolitan & American pizza

When making pizza, you'll first need to make the dough balls before they can be turned into those delicious wood-fired pieces of heaven.

The sizing of dough balls for Neapolitan and American pizza is pretty similar. Pizzas come in small, medium and large sizes. The calculator is set for medium pizzas. If you're planning to make your pizzas a different size, you can change this setting.

The figure below shows the right dough ball weight for the different pizza sizes. As you can see, the calculator adds a bit of weight for the American pizza, because the American pizza is supposed to be a bit thicker than the Neapolitan.

#### S Pizza = √ò 16 CM/6 INCH

- Neapolitan S = 160 gram dough ball
- American S = 175 gram dough ball

#### M Pizza = √ò 28CM/ 11 INCH

- Neapolitan M = 230 gram dough ball
- American M = 240 gram dough ball

#### L Pizza = √ò 34CM/ 13 INCH

- Neapolitan L = 300 gram dough ball
- American L = 315 gram dough ball

### Sicilian pizza

_also known as sfincione, focaccia, thick-crust, deep-dish or pan pizza._

The sizing of this pizza is a bit different, since this pizza isn't baked on the stone in your oven, but in a baking tray/pan that goes into your oven. Seeing as everyone has different baking trays, you can't just talk about small or medium pizzas.

For a 25x20cm / 10√ó8-inch baking tray, you'll need to make 650 grams of dough. If your baking tray is bigger or smaller, you'll have to play around with the weight until you find the perfect recipe for your baking pan.

## Flour

You produce flour by grinding grain, primarily wheat. There are two types of grain: a hard and a soft type. Hard grain is ground into a yellow flour, which is best for making pasta, and soft grain is ground into a white flour, which is great for bread and pizza. For the best possible pizza dough, you need a very fine white flour that can only be obtained after a long and slow process of grinding and sifting the wheat. The finest flour you can buy is known as tipo 00.

Due to its fineness, tipo 00 flour can absorb very large amounts of water, ranging from 50% all the way up to 100%. This allows your pizza to stay nice and crispy, without drying out in the oven.

If you can't find tipo 00 flour, you can use regular bread flour. You should never use all-purpose or cake flour. If you use bread flour, which hasn't been sieved as finely as tipo 00, you won't be able to use as much water. It's still possible to make pretty good pizzas with normal bread flour, but I'd recommend only using between 50% and 60% water to prevent the dough from getting soupy.

## Water

The pizza dough calculator assumes that you're using tipo 00 flour. If this is the case, you won't need to make any changes to the water percentage indicated.

In case you're using regular bread flour, it would be wise to set the parameter between 50% and 55%, since regular bread flour can't absorb large quantities of water. If you don't use less water with bread flour, your dough will get wet and soupy.

## Salt

Salt mainly adds flavour to your dough, but it also protects the dough against the effects of harmful bacteria and strengthens the gluten structure within the dough.

During the baking process, salt will give the crust a nice brown colour.

I would recommend using sea salt or kosher salt instead of table salt. Table salt is highly processed and only contains a fraction of the beneficial minerals that sea and kosher salt have.

## Yeast

Yeast is a single-celled organism that is invisible to the naked eye.

This organism feeds on the sugars and starch in your dough and releases gases that create little air pockets in the dough, which will make it rise and give it great flavour.

Why is there so little yeast in pizza dough?

That's because pizza dough is supposed to have a long, 8-hour rise. When you're giving your dough this much time to rise, even a little bit of yeast will do the trick. You could speed up the process by adding more yeast, but I wouldn't recommend that! A slow rise will enhance the dough's flavour, while also making it more nutritional!

What if I use dry yeast instead of fresh yeast?

No problem. You can also use dry yeast. Just make sure to use half as much as the amount of fresh yeast recommended by the calculator. That's because dry yeast is concentrated, so dry yeast is much more potent than the same amount of fresh yeast.

## Kneading

You'll need:

- 2 bowls
- A spoon
- Scales that can measure grams
- Flour, water, yeast, and salt

Go to the calculator, enter your preferred style and the number of pizzas you'd like to make.  
Simply press the calculate button and BOOM! you'll have a custom-made recipe.

### Mixing and Kneading

1. First, take 2 bowls and add the amount of flour specified by the calculator to one of them.

2. Fill the second bowl with the amount of water the calculator tells you to use. Make sure that the water is cold enough(anywhere between 12‚ÑÉ / 53‚Ñâ and 19‚ÑÉ / 66‚Ñâ will do).

3. Add your salt (preferably kosher salt or sea salt), stir it into the water until it's completely dissolved.

Now it's time to dissolve the yeast in the water, but there's one big problem: Yeast doesn't like salty water, as the salt will damage the yeast. Which means your dough won't rise the way it's supposed to.

4. So, you take some of the flour from bowl number one (about 10%) and mix it into your salty water. You don't have to be super accurate, but it is a very important step because the flour will protect the yeast against the salt, allowing it to do its job properly.

5. Ok. When you've stirred the salt and 10% of the flour into your water, you can add your fresh yeast. If you don't have fresh yeast, you can use dry yeast, but make sure to use half of the amount recommended by the calculator. (yes, it's a tiny amount, but trust me, it works!) When the yeast is stirred into the salty, flowery water you can add the rest of the flour to it.

6. Now all the ingredients are in the bowl, you can loosely mix them with a spoon or with your fingertips.

7. When everything is mixed together, you can start kneading the dough until it has an even, soft and elastic consistency. This usually takes about 8 to 20 minutes of kneading.

Go to Cold Fermenting to see what's next.

## Cold Fermenting

After the ingredients have been mixed and the dough has been kneaded, it's time for proofing and rising!

There are two options on how to let your dough proof and rise:

#### Option 1: Room temperature (6-24 hours)

1. After you knead the dough, you cover it with cling film or a damp towel and let it rest for 2 hours.
2. After 2 hours have passed, you can portion the dough into balls (See the calculator to find out how large you should make your balls of dough)
3. Cover the dough balls with cling film or a damp towel again and let them rise at room 18-21‚ÑÉ temperature for 4-22 hours.
4. Then make the pizzas.

#### Option 2: Next-level (8-72 hours)

When you'd like to make next-level dough that's tastier, easier to digest and has a bigger rise on the crust then try this:

1. After you knead your dough you can cold-proof it, meaning that you put it straight into the fridge (4 to 7‚ÑÉ) covered with cling film or a damp towel. Or even better, put it in an airtight container.

2. Then leave it in the fridge for 8 to 72 hours.
   When you take it out of the fridge, you place it on a lightly flowered tabletop so you can portion the dough into balls (Check the calculator to find out how large you should make your balls of dough).

3. The last step is very important, the dough has to be at room temperature before shaping it into pizzas so make sure to wait for 2 to 4 hours and then go go gooo!

Yesss! You've made your own pizza dough.

Hold up. Wait a minute‚Ä¶ What has just happened? What is proofing/fermenting and why does this make next-level pizzas?

After you first mixed the ingredients, you set 2 processes in motion.

‚Äì In the first, the dough will start to rise because the yeast feeds on the sugars in the dough and produces gases that cause the dough to increase in size.

‚Äì The other process is called proofing or fermenting. In this process, bacteria break down starches into simpler sugars.

The two processes start at the same time, but proofing takes a lot longer because the bacteria have to break down all the starches to make an airy dough that's easy to digest. That's why real good dough needs at least 8 hours of rising and preferably even more time to proof.

Proofing your dough for a long time leads to a tastier, more complex flavour, more beautiful charring and a pizza that's easier to digest. But you must stop the rising process by putting the dough in your fridge while the proofing process continues.

Now it's time to make pizzaaasss!
